1. Figure out why the transitions don't start in Cinnamon when they're supposed
   to. (Possible hint: the Adwaita timed theme works.)
2. Add a build step that computes sunrise/sunset for a user's location and
   inserts the times into the XML files. That way, users can re-install
   backgrounds periodically to ensure that the transition times match the time
   of year.
